    <h3> Physics of impact on granular media </h3>
    
    <div>
        <p> Granular media shows complex characteristics of both fluids and solids. I study the physics of rapid impact on granular media surfaces. Understanding this physics has implications for the design of robotic locomotion systems that seek to traverse unstable environments around them. It also enhances our understanding of animal locomotion and the role played by morphology and kinematics of animal foot in movement on granular media. I am currently working on the force response resulting from multiple intruders separated by a distance from one another. </p>

    <h3> Chemical sensing in aquatic invertebrates </h3>

    <div>
        <p> Aquatic invertebrates use their sensory hairs to navigate the chemical landscape around them, and track the source of odorants using their oldfactory appendages. They commonly use their antenna to “sniff” the dispersing adorants around them. This has important implications for the design of artificial biomimetic sensors that can accurately track and identify sources of chemicals and pollutants in the natural environment. </p>

    <h3> Turbulent plume dynamics </h3>

    <div>
        <p> The odorant plumes found in benthic environments are disperse and filamentous in nature. I use a combination of particle image velocimetry, laser induced fluorescence and numerical modeling to examine the instantaneous nature of turbulent odorant plumes in the context of aquatic chemical sensing.  </p>
